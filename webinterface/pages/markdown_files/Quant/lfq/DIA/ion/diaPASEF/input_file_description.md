Please upload the output of your analysis, and indicate what software
tool it comes from (this is necessary to correctly parse your table) - find more information in the "[How to use](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/available-modules/5-quant-lfq-ion-dia-diapasef/#how-to-use)" section of this module. For the raw data to run your workflow on, please see the section "[Data set](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/available-modules/5-quant-lfq-ion-dia-diapasef/#data-set)". 

Remember: contaminant sequences are already present in the fasta file 
associated to this module. **Do not add other contaminants** to your 
search. This is important when using MaxQuant and FragPipe, among other tools.
