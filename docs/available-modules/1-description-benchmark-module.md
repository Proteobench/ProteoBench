# Description of a module

A benchmark module compares the performance of different data analysis workflows based on module-specific, predefined metrics. It provides a specific set of input files (e.g., mass spectrometry files and a sequence database) and it requires specific workflow output files (e.g., identified peptides). Based on these workflow output files, metrics are calculated as defined by the module and can be compared to previously validated benchmark runs. As each benchmark module defines specific workflow input files and metrics, it evaluates only a limited set of characteristics of the data analysis workflow.

# Downloading benchmarking data
The data uploaded for benchmarking can be downloaded per analysis together with the intermediate file generated by the ProteoBench module. To do so, go to the appropriate module and look for the "download raw datasets". You can select the analysis and then download any provided data stored on the ProteoBench server.

All datasets are provided for download at https://proteobench.cubimed.rub.de/datasets/
