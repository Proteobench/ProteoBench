# Description

A benchmark module compares the performance of different data analysis workflows based on module-specific, predefined metrics. It provides a specific set of input files (e.g., mass spectrometry files and a sequence database) and it requires specific workflow output files (e.g., identified peptides). Based on these workflow output files, metrics are calculated as defined by the module and can be compared to previously validated benchmark runs. As each benchmark module defines specific workflow input files and metrics, it evaluates only a limited set of characteristics of the data analysis workflow.
