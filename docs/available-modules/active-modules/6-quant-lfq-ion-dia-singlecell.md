# DIA quantification - ion level - Single Cell

This module compares the sensitivity and quantification accuracy for data acquired with data-independent acquisition (DIA) on an Astral for low-input data.
It is similar to the DIA quantification module "ion-level" described [here](#4-quant-lfq-ion-dia-aif).

**We are working on the documentation: more information coming soon.**
