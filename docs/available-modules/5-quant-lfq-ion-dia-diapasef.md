# DIA quantification - ion level - diaPASEF

This module compares the sensitivity and quantification accuracy for data acquired with data-independent acquisition (DIA) on a timsTOF (Bruker).
It is similar to the DIA quantification module "ion-level" described [here](#4-quant-lfq-ion-dia-aif).

**We are working on the documentation: more information comming soon.**
