`ProteoBench <https://proteobench.cubimed.rub.de/>`_ is an open and collaborative platform for community-curated benchmarks for proteomics 
data analysis pipelines. Our goal is to allow a continuous, easy, and controlled comparison of 
proteomics data analysis workflows.

ProteoBench provides a centralized web platform for developers and end-users to compare proteomics 
data analysis pipelines. This community-curated effort will allow for an easy and controlled comparison 
of tools developed or used by the participants to other state-of-the-art pipelines for specific 
applications. The goal is not to select a single best one-fits-all data analysis workflow, but to allow:

1. **end-users** to identify a good workflow to fulfill their specific needs
2. **developers** to identify the specific strengths and weaknesses in their workflows, guiding the development process
3. **the field** to easily position a newly published workflow within the context of the existing state-of-the-art

Description
===========

Participants (both end-users and developers) can download a set of input files (e.g., raw MS files, 
search databases, or spectral libraries) tailored to specific benchmark metrics. They can then analyze 
the data with any workflow, and upload the results in a homogenized format. A set of metrics will be 
retrieved or calculated from these results and can be visualized alongside all the other metrics 
calculated from the results of other participants (or of curated benchmark runs).

Goals and non-goals
===================

ProteoBench:

1. Allows for an easy and controlled comparison of existing data analysis workflows
2. Provides a frame of reference for newly developed workflows
3. Documents and implements benchmarks that each highlight strengths or weaknesses of data analysis workflow (steps)
4. Evolves continuously, according to the needs of the field
5. **DOES NOT** point to a single best one-fits-all data analysis workflow
6. **SHOULD NOT**  be used as evidence for generalized statements about a workflow’s performance
7. **SHOULD NOT**  be used by developers as single performance measure of their workflow

Organization
============

The github repository for ProteoBench can be found `here <https://github.com/Proteobench/Proteobench>`_.

ProteoBench documentation is divided into two main parts:

The different :doc:`modules/index` that exist, how they evolve and how to used them.

The :doc:`developer-guide/index` provides information on the structure of the project and how to contribute.
