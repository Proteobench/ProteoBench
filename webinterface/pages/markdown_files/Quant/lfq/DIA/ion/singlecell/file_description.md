The raw files used for this module were acquired on an Astral. They can be downloaded from the 
proteomeXchange repository PXD049412 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD049412) (TODO: Add to ProteoBench server as well)

**It is imperative not to rename the files once downloaded!**

Download the zipped FASTA file here: [ProteoBenchFASTA_MixedSpecies_HYE.zip](https://proteobench.cubimed.rub.de/fasta/ProteoBenchFASTA_MixedSpecies_HYE.zip).
The fasta file provided for this module contains the three species
present in the samples **and contaminant proteins**.
