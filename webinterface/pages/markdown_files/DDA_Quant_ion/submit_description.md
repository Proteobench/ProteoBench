**Please make these results available to the entire community!**

To do so, you need to provide the parameter file that corresponds to 
your analysis. You can upload it in the drag and drop area below. 
See [here](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/3-DDA-Quantification-ion-level/)
for all compatible parameter files.
In this module, we keep track of the following parameters, if you feel 
that some important information is missing, please add it in the 
`Comments for submission` field. 
- software tool name and version
- search engine name and version
- FDR threshold for PSM, peptide and protein level
- match between run (or not)
- precursor mass tolerance
- enzyme (although for these data it should be Trypsin)
- number of missed-cleavages
- minimum and maximum peptide length
- fixed and variable modifications
- maximum number of modifications
- minimum and maximum precursor charge

Once you confirm that the metadata is correct (and corresponds to the 
table you uploaded before generating the plot), a button will appear.
Press it to submit. 

**If some parameters are not in your parameter file, it is important that 
you provide them in the "comments" section.**

Once submitted, you will see a weblink that will prompt you to a 
pull request on the github repository of the module. Please write down
its number to keep track of your submission. If it looks good, one of 
us will accept it and make your data public. 

Please contact us if you have any issue. To do so, you can create an 
[issue](https://github.com/Proteobench/ProteoBench/issues/new) on our 
github, or [send us an email](mailto:proteobench@eubic-ms.org?subject=ProteoBench_query).
