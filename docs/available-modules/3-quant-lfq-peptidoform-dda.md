# DDA quantification - peptidoforms

This module compares the sensitivity and quantification accuracy for data acquired with data-dependent acquisition (DDA) on a Q Exactive HF-X Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher).
It is based on the DDA quantification module "ion-level" described [here](#2-quant-lfq-ion-dda). Data and metrics are the same, the difference is that in this module we focus on peptidoform quantities summarised from the precursor ion quantities.
