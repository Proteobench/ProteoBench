tool it comes from (this is necessary to correctly parse your table) - find more information in the "[How to use](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/available-modules/active-modules/2-quant-lfq-ion-dda/#how-to-use)" section of this module. To the raw data to run your workflow on please see the section "[Data set](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/available-modules/active-modules/2-quant-lfq-ion-dda/#data-set)". You can download an (*incomplete*) MaxQuant file example [here](https://github.com/Proteobench/ProteoBench/blob/main/test/data/quant/quant_lfq_ion_DDA_QExactive/MaxQuant_2_5_1_evidence_sample.txt) for testing.

Remember: contaminant sequences are already present in the fasta file 
associated to this module. **Do not add other contaminants** to your 
search. This is important when using MaxQuant and FragPipe, among other tools.
