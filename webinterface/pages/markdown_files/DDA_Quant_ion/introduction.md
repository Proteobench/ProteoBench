This module compares the MS1-level quantification tools for
data-dependent acquisition (DDA). The raw files provided for
this module are presented in the comprehensive LFQ benchmark
dataset from [Van Puyvelde et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01216-6).
The samples contain tryptic peptides from Homo sapiens,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli, mixed in different
ratios (condition A and condition B), with three replicates of each
condition. With these samples, we calculate three metrics:
- To estimate the sensitivity of the workflows, we report the
number of unique precursors (charged modified sequence) quantified
in a minimum of 1 to 6 runs.
- To estimate the accuracy of the workflows, we report the mean 
absolute difference between measured and expected log2-transformed 
fold changes between conditions for proteins of the same species.

ProteoBench plots these three metrics to visualize workflow outputs
    from different tools, with different versions, and/or different
sets of parameters for the search and quantification.
The full description of the pre-processing steps and metrics
calculation is available [here](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/3-DDA-Quantification-ion-level/).
